I see! Here is the **full version of the `README.md` file** with all sections, including your specific request for the text on starting the development server:

# Project Name

## Overview

This project allows you to [brief description of the project]. You can run the project either locally using npm or in a Docker container.

## Running the Project

You can run the project using one of two methods: locally with npm or using Docker.

---

### Option 1: Running Locally with npm

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install the project dependencies**:
   First, make sure you have npm installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Run the project in Visual Studio Code** (Optional):
   Alternatively, if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can open the project in VS Code and press `F5` to run the project directly from the IDE.

### Option 2: Running with Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   First, build the Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t website -f .dockerfile .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
   Once the image is built, you can run the project inside a Docker container with the following command:
   ```bash
   docker run --name website -d --restart unless-stopped -p 3001:3001 website
   ```

   This will start the project and map the local port 3001 to the container's port 3001. You can access the project at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Environment Variables

Some environment variables need to be configured for the project to run properly. Here are the variables you may need to set up:

- `PORT`: The port number for the application (default is `3001`).
- `DB_HOST`: The database host.
- `DB_USER`: The database user.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: The database password.

### Conclusion

Choose the method that best fits your needs. Whether you prefer running the project locally with npm or using Docker, both options will allow you to start working with the project efficiently.
```

This full `README.md` includes sections for running the project with both **npm** and **Docker**, as well as a brief **Overview** and **Environment Variables** section, in case you have specific environment setup instructions. The section you requested about starting the development server has also been included. You can copy this directly into your `README.md` file.
